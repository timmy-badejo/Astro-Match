# Astro-Match
AstroMatch is a React Native / Expo app that helps users explore zodiac compatibility. Users can sign up with their name and sign, browse zodiac information, and view compatibility results between signs. This project was built for MDIA 3295 to practice feature development, manual testing, and QA documentation.
